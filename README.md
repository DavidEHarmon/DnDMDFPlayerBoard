CAD CAM Files to make a 15x15 MDF DnD Player Board on a CNC Router
This project was created to help me track files in creating a modular DnD playing board for our group.

The intial board is 1.5 Inch Thick MDF with .125 milled slots creating a 15x15 block 1.1 inch square field.
The slots in the board allow for me to make building walls that slip into the slots and we can rearrage our board as needed.

There will be magnets drilled into the sides so that we can ultimately make a 30x30 playing field that consists of over 900 player
blocks.

I will add the  building template files as I create them.

All CAD/CAM was done on Aspire 8.2 and the cut files are output for a ShopBot in INCHES
